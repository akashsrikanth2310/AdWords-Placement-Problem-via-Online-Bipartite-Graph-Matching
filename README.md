We are given a set of advertisers each of whom has a daily budget 𝐵𝑖. When a user performs a query, an ad request is placed online and a group of advertisers can then bid for that advertisement slot. The bid of advertiser 𝑖 for an ad request 𝑞  is denoted as  𝑏𝑖𝑞. We assume that the bids are small with respect to the daily budgets of the advertisers (i.e., for each 𝑖  and 𝑞, 𝑏𝑖𝑞≪ 𝐵𝑖). Moreover, each advertisement slot can be allocated to at most one advertiser and the advertiser is charged his bid from his/her budget. The objective is to maximize the amount of money received from the advertisers.
